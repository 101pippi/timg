timg - Terminal Image Viewer
============================

A viewer that uses 24-Bit color capabilities and unicode character blocks
to display images in the terminal.

Displays regular images, plays animated gifs or allows to scroll static images.

Very useful for if you want to have a quick visual check without starting a
bulky image viewer ... and don't care about resolution.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hzeller/timg.git
cd timg/src
sudo apt-get install libwebp-dev libgraphicsmagick++-dev    # required libs.
make
sudo make install
```

### Synopsis

```
usage: ./timg [options] <image>
Options:
        -g<w>x<h>  : Output pixel geometry. Default from terminal 132x88
        -s[<ms>]   : Scroll horizontally (optionally: delay ms (60)).
        -t<timeout>: Animation or scrolling: only display for this number of seconds.
        -c<num>    : Animation or scrolling: number of runs through a full cycle.
        -v         : Print version and exit.
If both -c and -t are given, whatever comes first stops.
```

### Examples
```bash
timg some-image.jpg         # display a static image

timg some-animated.gif      # show an animated gif (stop with Ctrl-C)
timg -t5 some-animated.gif  # show animated gif for 5 seconds

timg -s some-image.jpg      # scroll a static image as banner (stop with Ctrl-C)
timg -s100 some-image.jpg   # scroll with 100ms delay right to left
timg -s-100 some-image.jpg  # negative scroll delay scrolls left to right

# Also, you could store the output and cat later to your terminal...
timg some-image.jpg > /tmp/imageout.txt
cat /tmp/imageout.txt

```

Note, this requires that your terminal can display 24 bit colors and is able
to display the character â–€ (U+2580, 'Upper Half Block'). If not, it doesn't
show anything or it is garbage.

Tested terminals: `konsole` >= 2.14.1, `gnome-terminal` >= 3.6.2 look good,
recent xterms also seem to work (albeit with less color richness).

Linux console seems to be limited in colors and does not show the block
character - if you know how to enable the unicode character or full color
there, please let me know.

For Mac users, the iTerm2 >= 3.x should work, please confirm if you have this
setup.
